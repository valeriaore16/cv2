  <h3>10 Most asked Java Questions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Difference between JRE, JDK, JVM?</strong><br>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment: usually downloaded as Java software.<br>
      The JRE consists of the JVM and supporting libraries. <br>The JRE is the runtime component of Java software and is all we need to run any Java application.<br>
      JDK stands for Java Development Kit: Is JRE + development tools (java compiler, debugger)<br>JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine: It translates and executes the Java bytecode, It’s the entity which transforms Java to become a “portable
      language”
    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the main method? Why do we need one in java? Do we have to have a main method in java? </strong><br>
      Main method is the starting point of an application <br>
      Whenever we execute a program, the main() is the first function to be executed.<br>
      It is not mandatory to have a main method in java, without main() our Java code will compile but won’t run.
    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is polymorphism? Types of Polymorphism? </strong><br>
      Ability of an object to take on many forms, allows us to perform a task in multiple ways. <br>Combination of overloading and overriding is known as Polymorphism <br>
      Types:<br> Compile time polymorphism(Static binding) → Method overloading <br> Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic binding) → Method overriding
    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is encapsulation? </strong><br>
      Protective shield that hides the data. <br>This data will be hidden from the other classes, achieved by declaring all the variables in the class as private, can be accessed with getters and setters </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is a garbage collector and what is a Garbage Collector?</strong><br>
      Garbage collection is the process of looking at memory and identifying which objects are in use and which are not and deleting unused objects. <br>Once an object is created it uses some memory and the memory remains allocated until there are
      references for the use of the object. <br>We use System.gc() to call the garbage collector.
    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is Java regular expression(Regex)?</strong><br>
      Is an API for defining String patterns that can be used for searching, manipulating and editing a text, provided under the java.util.regex package.<br>

    <li><strong>What is the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference? </strong><br>Pass by value is a mechanism of copying the function parameter value to another variable.<br>Pass by reference is a mechanism of passing the actual
      parameters to the function.</li><br><br>

    <li><strong>What is autoboxing and unboxing?</strong><br>
      Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. <br>For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double <br>
      Unboxing is converting an object of a wrapper type(Integer) to its corresponding primitive(int) value</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is Java regular expression(Regex)?</strong><br>
      Is an API for defining String patterns that can be used for searching, manipulating and editing a text, provided under the java.util.regex package.
    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference? </strong> <br>
      Pass by value is a mechanism of copying the function parameter value to another variable. <br>
      Pass by reference is a mechanism of passing the actual parameters to the function.
    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>How many catch blocks can we have? Which catch block will get executed if you get an ArithmeticException? </strong> <br>
      There can be many catch blocks for a single try block and it is not necessary that each try block must be followed by a catch block. <br>
      It should be followed by either a catch block or a finally block. <br>
      However only the catch block encountered first on the call stack that satisfies the condition for the exception will be executed for that particular exception, rest will be ignored.
    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What is binary search and how is it working? </strong> <br>
      Binary search will compare the target value starting from the middle of the list and it keeps continuing to compare every time from the middle element until finding the last two values. <br>
      It is very fast comparing to linear search

    </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>What are the primitives and wrapper classes?</strong> <br>
      Primitives are data types in Java.<br>
      There are a total of 8 primitive data types in Java: byte, shirt,int, long, float, double,char, boolean. </li><br><br>
