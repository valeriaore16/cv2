  <h3>Tell me about your project</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      My current project is with OSA company where I worked on Customer Service application and our application mainly deals with connecting healthcare customer representatives.<br>
      As a customer representative, the user is able to retrieve and modify information of providers and patience by accessing only 1 system. <br>So, my main responsibility was to automate a regression suite for that application.<br>
      In my project we do automation with Selenium and Java as a scripting language using the Cucumber framework followed by a POM design pattern.
      Our Cucumber tests are run and verified using Junit assertions.<br> Also, in my current project I perform API testing for the POST/PUT/GET and DELETE requests. <br> I do Database and manual testing as well. <br>At this moment we are using
      Jenkins for continuous integration and GitHub to store our source code. <br>In my project we follow Agile and our sprints are 2 weeks long, in which daily stand ups are held, along with sprint planning, demo and retro meetings.<br>
