  <h3>Tell me about yourself</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I am a QA engineer with 4 years of experience in the software testing field. I have experience in both automation and manual testing on Web and Mobile applications. As a QA engineer, I was involved in all phases of Software Testing Life
      Cycle, starting from requirement analysis till production deployment and worked in both waterfall and agile environments.
      Performed different types of testing such as Regression, Smoke, Database, Sanity, Ad-ho, Positive and Negative testing
      Coming to my automation experience I worked with different sets of tools, languages and frameworks, such as Selenium, Cucumber, GitHub and Jenkins. My current project is with OSA where I do UI automation using Selenium WebDriver and Java.
      Also, I am performing API testing using Rest-Assured and Postman. I am confident with POST/PUT/GET and DELETE requests. I have used the Oracle SQL(structure query language) for database testing and configured the JDBC(java database
      connectivity) in my automation
      On top of my technical skills, I am a team player and quick learner.
