  <h3>10 Most asked Soft Skills questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1.WHAT IS STLC</strong><br>
      STLC(SOFTWARE TESTING LIFE CYCLE)<br>
      Sequence of different activities performed during the software testing process <br>
      Testing process which has specific steps to be executed in a definite sequence to ensure that the quality goals have been met. <br>In the STLC process, each activity is carried out in a planned and systematic way.<br>
      STLC phases: <br>Requirement, Planning,Analysis,Design,Implementation,Execution,Conclusion,Closure </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>2.WHAT IS SDLC? </strong><br>
      SDLC (SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE)<br>
      Sequence of different activities performed during the software development process <br>
      Systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built. <br>SDLC process aims to produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations. <br>SDLC consists of a detailed plan which
      explains how to plan, build and maintain specific software.<br>SDLC phases: <br>Requirement , Planning, Design, Coding, Testing.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>3.WHY DO SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS HAVE BUGS?</strong>\<br>
      There are various reasons why a system might have bugs, such as bad design, coding errors, miscommunication, continuous change in requirements, rushing to meet deadlines and also the complexity of the application.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>4.CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION </strong><br>
      VERIFICATION <br>
      When you are analyzing test cases to ensure we cover all scenarios and we are creating the right product and NO coding is involved <br>
      Verification is the static testing.<br>
      Verification means: Are we building the product right? <br><br>
      VALIDATION <br>
      Is when we are executing test cases and writing code to verify the system.<br>
      Validation is dynamic testing.<br>
      Validation means: Are we building the right product?</li><br><br>

    <li><strong>5.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATIC AND DYNAMIC TESTING?</strong><br>
      STATIC TESTING(done in verification stage)<br>
      Is a White box Testing technique where the developers verify or test their code with the help of a checklist to find errors in it, this type of testing is done without running the developed application or program.<br>
      DYNAMIC TESTING(done in validation stage)<br>
      Is done by executing the actual application with valid inputs to check the expected output.<br>
      Examples: Integration Testing, System testing, Regression and Acceptance Testing.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>6.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLACK BOX AND WHITE BOX TESTING?</strong><br>
      BLACK BOX TESTING <br>
      Is a software testing method in which the internal structure of the item being tested is NOT known to the tester <br>
      It is a technique that testers do without knowing the internal structure of the code. <br>
      Mainly applicable to SMOKE & REGRESSION TESTING <br>
      We only do black box testing <br>
      WHITE BOX TESTING <br>
      Is a software testing method in which the internal structure of the item being tested is known by the tester <br>
      Mainly applicable to lower levels of testing: UNIT TESTING & INTEGRATION TESTING <br>
      If you are able to see the code, it is White Box Testing , any testing that is done by developer is White Box Testing, for us to be able to do WHITE BOX TESTING we need to know the internal structure of the code, which means we need to access
      the code, but as a tester we don’t have access to developer code </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>7.WHAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTING DO YOU KNOW?</strong><br>
      Unit testing <br>
      Integration testing <br>
      System testing <br>
      Regression testing <br>
      Ad-hoc <br>
      Smoke testing <br>
      Performance testing <br>
      Load testing <br>
      White box and Black box testing </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>8.IN WHICH PHASE SHOULD TESTING BEGIN?</strong><br>
      It is always better to start the application right from the beginning of SDLC rather than waiting for the testing phase.<br> The important entry criteria for testing are:<br>
      Once a test plan, test cases are written and approved <br>
      Once the environment is ready <br>
      Once the build is given to QA team to test <br>
      Test data is ready </li><br><br>

    <li><strong>9.What is AD-Hoc testing?</strong> <br>
      Informal Testing which is performed by testers <br>
      Application is tested randomly with random inputs <br>
      When you do it you don’t need documentation, test plan, test case <br>
      Ad-hoc testing is usually done to discover the issues or defects which cannot be found by following the formal process.</li><br><br>

    <li><strong>10.WHAT IS UNIT TESTING AND HAVE YOU EVER DONE UNIT TESTING?</strong><br>
      Is a software testing method(Testing small pieces of code)<br>
      Is done by developers <br>
      No, I haven’t done unit testing. Unit Testing is done by developers before they deploy their code from the Development environment to QA environment.</li><br>
