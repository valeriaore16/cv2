  <h3>Tell me about your framework</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In my framework, I was developing my testing code using Java programming language and Selenium WebDriver.<br>
      I used Maven to manage and centralize my dependencies and Cucumber and Selenium as dependencies in my framework.<br>
      Since it is Behavior Driven Development(BDD) I created one of my feature files where I use the Gherkin language to create my scenarios and scenario outline.<br>
      My framework was structured based on the POM(Page Object Model) that every page element goes to one class and it makes maintenance easy to maintain the Web Elements and to keep my code organized and clean.<br>
      I also have a step definition package where I implemented every step of feature file scenarios.<br>
      I have created other separate folders for my runner classes for regression and smoke tests and for other runners.<br>
      At the same time, I store all my utilities for JDBC, ExcelUtils, Configuration Util, Reusable Selenium Utils and Driver classes under the Utils package.<br>
      And I achieve continuous integration and schedule my Regression suite and Smoke test using Jenkins and it is generating the cucumber html report.<br>
      I also push my code to the remote repository using Git with GitHub.
